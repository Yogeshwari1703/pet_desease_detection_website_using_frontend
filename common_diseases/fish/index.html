                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Though technically not a disease, ammonia poisoning is incredibly common in new fish tanks. Ammonia is a byproduct of the process of organic material breaking down and it can be incredibly toxic for fish. Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate, which is less harmful.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul class="symptoms-list">
                            <li>Labored breathing</li>
                            <li>Gasping at the surface</li>

                            <li>Lying at the bottom of the tank</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Prevention is the best option. Make sure any new tank has gone through the nitrogen cycle and has a fully established colony of beneficial bacteria before adding fish. Ammonia spikes can be managed with frequent water changes. It may also help to siphon your substrate during water changes to remove accumulated organic matter.</p>

                        <p>Not actually a worm but rather a parasitic crustacean, anchor worms are most commonly seen in pond fish but can infect aquarium fish as well. These parasites embed themselves in the muscle, sometimes burrowing into the internal organs. A raised ulcer typically forms at the point of attachment and may provide an opportunity for secondary infections to set in.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Anchor worms are usually only seen in outdoor koi ponds and newly imported tropical fish. Quarantine is essential for all new fish and any that have been infected with anchor worms. Remove adult worms by hand using forceps and treat the wound with fish-safe antiseptic. Continue removing them weekly until no more adult worms develop.</p>

                        <p>Caused by a ciliated protozoa called Brooklynella hostilis, this disease most commonly affects anemonefish but will infect others as well.

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The most common treatment for this disease is a combination of formalin and malachite green. Malachite green can be dosed at a concentration of 0.10 ppm for 7 to 10 days. Formalin is best administered as a bath with 0.5 mL of formalin per gallon of water. Take care when using formalin on fish with severe skin damage, as they may be more sensitive.</p>

                        <p>Caused by a protozoan parasite that attacks the skin and gills, velvet is also called gold dust disease due to its dusty yellow appearance on the skin. Velvet is caused by different parasites in freshwater and marine fish, with freshwater velvet being caused by Piscinoodinium (or simply Oodinium) and marine velvet being caused by Amyloodinium parasites.</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Another protozoan parasite, Hexamita, most commonly affects cichlids, gourami and betta fish. They attack the intestines of fish that are already stressed by crowded conditions, poor water quality or shipping, causing weight loss and, in serious cases, death.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul class="symptoms-list">
                            <li>Weight loss</li>
                            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                            <li>White, stringy feces</li>
                            <li>Death</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Prompt treatment of hexamita infestation is essential to prevent serious weight loss and death. If the fish is still eating, the best treatment is metronidazole in food. If the fish has stopped eating, add the medication to the water at a dosage of 250 mg per 10 gallons.</p>
